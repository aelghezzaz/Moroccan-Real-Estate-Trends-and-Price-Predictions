## Overview 🌍
This project focuses on analyzing Moroccan real estate data to predict property prices using machine learning. We scrape property data, clean it, and then apply various machine learning models to predict future trends.

## Key Features 🚀
- **Web Scraping**: Gathered data from multiple real estate listings.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed trends, price variations, and key factors affecting property prices.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Built predictive models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the models on Google Colab and Hugging Face Spaces for real-time predictions.

## Colab Notebook 📑
You can experiment with our model and see real-time predictions in action:
