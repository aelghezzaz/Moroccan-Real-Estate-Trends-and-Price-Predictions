## Introduction 🌍
Hello there! Are you ready for an exciting journey through Morocco's real estate scene? From the bustling markets to the hidden gems of Marrakech and Chefchaouen, we're diving into the heart of it all. Join us as we decode the secrets of Moroccan property prices and unveil the magic of predictive analytics. Get ready to explore, analyze, and uncover the possibilities in this thrilling adventure! 🌟🔍

## Data Scraping 💻🔨
In the realm of real estate analytics, **data is king** 👑. But how do we access this treasure trove of information scattered across the vast expanse of the internet? Enter **web scraping** – the digital prospector's tool of choice.

**Web Scraping Tools and Libraries Used:**
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for parsing HTML and XML documents to extract data from web pages.
- **Selenium**: A tool for automating web browsers, helpful for scraping dynamic content.
- **Requests**: A library used to send HTTP requests to retrieve HTML content.

### Key Data Sources:
- **[Moroccan Real Estate Listings](#)** - The primary source for property listings.
- **[Economic Data](#)** - Additional datasets to capture economic indicators that influence property prices.

---

## Data Cleaning 🧹✨
Before diving into analysis, the raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍📉
We performed a comprehensive **EDA** to understand trends in property pricing, regional disparities, and the factors driving these prices.

**Key Libraries Used:**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and identifying patterns.

---

## Model Development 🤖📈
To predict future real estate prices, we employed machine learning models, such as:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

**Tools Used for Modeling:**
- **TensorFlow**: For implementing neural networks and deep learning models.
- **scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning models.

---

## Model Deployment 🚀🌍
We deployed the model via **Google Colab** to allow users to experiment with real-time predictions.
